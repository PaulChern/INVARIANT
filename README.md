# INVARIANT
### Phase field / Landau model builder:
- Displacements modes analysis
- Modulate modes in supercell, generate Domain walls (DWs)
- Invariant generator
- Landau model builder, Generate Density Functional Theory (DFT) training sets by phonon frozen-in.
- Finite Element Method (FEM), Minimization, and Finite Differences nonlinear solver on large scale continuous model
- openmp parallelization
- dynamics under external electric field
- Nudged Elastic Bands (NEB) and Growing String Method (GSM) to explore the phase transition, dynamics, and domain wall structures
- Mollwide projection
- Examples: Boracite (To be added: Perovskite, Spinel, Rutile, Pyrochlore)
### Todo:
- including magnetism symmetry analysis
- adding Atomistic Green's Function (AGF) method to study scattering and ultrafast non-equilibrium dynamics
- including electron phonon coupling (EPC) by fitting phonon dependent Tight-Binding (TB) model from DFT molecular dynamics (MD).
