# INVARIANT
### Phase field / Landau model builder
- displacements modes analysis
- Invariant generator
- Landau model builder (Generate DFT training sets by phonon frozen-in.)
- FEM/Minimization solver on large scale continuous model
- Nudged Elastic Bands (NEB) and Growing String Method (GSM) to explore the phase transition, dynamics, and domain wall structures
- Mollwide projection
- Examples: Boracite (To be added: Perovskite, Spinel, Rutile, Pyrochlore)
